# Ploty Belly Button Biodiversity

## PURPOSE OF THE ANALYSIS:

The purpose of this analysis is to complete the dashboard Roza has been working on, so she is able to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. 
Specifically, her volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.
